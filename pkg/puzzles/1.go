// Provides the solution for day 1.
//
// In day 1, we must help The Historians find the location IDs of historically
// significant locations where the Chief Historian could be found after disappearing.
//
// To do this, we must combine two individual lists of location IDs found by the
// historians, and and the distances between each of their IDs. We can do this
// by aligning the two lists of IDs from smallest to largest, subtracting their
// values to get individual distances between locations, and then summing the
// distances to get the total distance between the two lists.
