# Input data

As per the author's request, no input data is stored in this repository:

> Please don't \[copy or redistribute parts of Advent of Code\]. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

Any file located within this directory is created by me, and is free to use according to the repositories' license.

## Getting input data

To get input data for the puzzles, you must sign up to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and download your personalised input data for each puzzle.

To get input data for unit tests, you must copy the examples from each puzzle's description.

## Using input data

For puzzles, save your personalized input file within this directory with the filename `{year}/{day}.txt`, e.g., `2024/01.txt` for day 1 of 2024.

For tests, save the examples from the puzzle's description within this directory with the filename `{year}/{day}_test.txt`, e.g., `2024/01_test.txt` for day 1 of 2024.

Both types of files also support variations, e.g., `{year}/{day}-{var}.txt` and `{year}/{day}_test-{var}.txt`, which may be used for puzzles with multiple provided examples, or for custom input files.
